BIG DATA

DEFINITION
----------
1.Bigdata is all about data, huge volume of data.
2.10000+ Technologies(like hadoop and spark) is under bigdata.
3.Bigdata derived from data.
4.Data is a collection of information that can be stored and processed.
5.Data can be anything like letters, numbers, symbols, images, audio, video, files.
6.Data can be in anyform like raw, structured and unorganized.
7.When machine tries to store and process data more than its capacity, problem occurs that is called 
bigdata(problem data).
8.Small/Large amount of data which becomes problem to store/process is called bigdata.
9.Bigdata is not only for volume, we can use it to solve different probems in different usecases.
10.We can use any technology to solve problem, its not mandatory to use only bigdata technologies to solve. 
11.Bigdata has solution for all problems, it is an open source we can also propose a Technology(solution for a problem).
12.Bigdata is for purely data processing, data analytics, data storage, data testing, data visualization.

PROBLEMS IN DATA
----------------
Problems in data are infinity.
1.Volume - large amount of data (Eg:- A movie file size is 4.001GB storing in 4GB pendrive, don't have
 enough storage to store 1mb, that 1mb is bigdata because not able to store and process, If don't have 
 space for 1kb or 10000000TB to store and process is also called bigdata.)
 Companies process data in GB, TB, PB based on their projects/standards.
 Small comany used data in GBs (Large volume of data for their company standards).
 Medium comany used data in TBs (Large volume of data for their company standards). 
 Large comany used data in PBs (Large volume of data for their company standards).

2.Velocity - Speed in Transaction or transfering data (how fast the request is sent and getting back the response).
I'm doing an online payment its taking too much of time nearly 1hr to finish, I can't wait for 1hr so the  
delay Problem is not with the database or engine but with the transfering technology.

3.Variety - Structured(comma separated and tab sepearted), Semi-Structured(xml, json), 
UnStructured(audio, video, image) are varieties of data.

4.Value - Quality of the data.


DATA LAYERS
-----------
Bigdata has N data layers, each layers has n technologies/solution for problems.
1.Data storage - 500+ databases in Bigdata (NoSQL).
2.Data processing/analysis - 2000+ data processing/Analysis technolgies in Bigdata (Hadoop and Spark)
3.Data analytics (DS/AI/ML)
4.Data scheduling
5.Data testing
6.Data pipeline
7.Data Visualization (Tableau, clickview, microstatergy).
